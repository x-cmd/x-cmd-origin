DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides
       both high-level operations and full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see giteveryday(7) for a useful minimum set of commands. The Git
       User's Manual[1] has a more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You
       can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual page gives you an
       overview of the command-line command syntax.

       A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at
       https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is given then
           all available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up the manual page
           for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See git-help(1) for more
           information, because git --help ...  is converted internally into git help ....
